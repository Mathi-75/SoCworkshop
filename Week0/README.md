## Week 0: Introduction and Environment Setup

### Day 0 - Tools Installation
<br>
  The first day focused on getting acquainted with the course structure and setting up the necessary open-source tools for VLSI design and simulation on a Linux environment. This foundational setup is crucial for all the upcoming labs and projects.

  The primary tools installed were:
  * **Icarus Verilog (`iverilog`):** A Verilog compiler used for simulating digital circuits.
  * **GTKWave:** A powerful waveform viewer for visualizing and analyzing the output of simulations.
  * **Yosys:** An open-source framework for Verilog RTL synthesis, which translates the hardware description into a gate-level netlist.

  After the installation process, I verified that each tool was correctly set up and accessible from the terminal.

  #### Tool Installation Verification
