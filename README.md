## Week 0: Introduction and Environment Setup

### Day 0: Course Introduction and Tool Installation

The first day focused on getting acquainted with the course structure and setting up the necessary open-source tools for VLSI design and simulation on a Linux environment. This foundational setup is crucial for all the upcoming labs and projects.

The primary tools installed were:
* **Icarus Verilog (`iverilog`):** A Verilog compiler used for simulating digital circuits.
* **GTKWave:** A powerful waveform viewer for visualizing and analyzing the output of simulations.
* **Yosys:** An open-source framework for Verilog RTL synthesis, which translates the hardware description into a gate-level netlist.

After the installation process, I verified that each tool was correctly set up and accessible from the terminal.

#### Tool Installation Verification

The following screenshots confirm the successful installation and basic invocation of the essential tools.

**1. Icarus Verilog (`iverilog`)**

Running the `iverilog` command in the terminal displays its usage options, confirming that the compiler is ready to use.

**2. GTKWave**

Launching `gtkwave` from the terminal successfully opens the GUI, which is now ready to load and display `.vcd` waveform files for analysis.

**3. Yosys Open Synthesis Suite**

Executing the `yosys` command starts the synthesis suite, confirming that the tool is installed and operational for future synthesis tasks.
